artist-guide
============

Website for Illuminus Festival, Boston's first "Nuit Blanche" arts festival to take place the night of October 25th 2014. The artists guide provides a simple system for an administrator to add, edit, and remove information about artists and their projects. The information can then be displayed in a variety of ways for various purposes - such as an artist's gallery - as well as eventually integrating mapping and geolocation services.
